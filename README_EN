This is a lightweight registration form for the Repertoire of Myriad Melodies score webpage. All of its data is stored in a local browser (such as via, edge), which can be used to record the score, score, difficulty, note count, and accuracy of the music you play. You can star mark the spectral planes, which can help you find them faster. Due to being built in HTML format, it has strong scalability. I have retired from Repertoire of Myriad Melodies and therefore will no longer provide updates.
